...Priceless
3's company
50 dollar pretzel
52 slices of American cheese
A babe in the woods
a big Commie rat
a bird in the hand
A bird in the hand is messy
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
A bottomless pit
A boy's best friend
A carrot on a stick
A census taker once tried to test
A chip off the old block
A chip on his shoulder
A dedicated gardener dwells within
A drop in the bucket
A feast for sore eyes
A feast for the eyes
A flood of tears
A former greenskeeper
A fountain of energy
A Garden is a Friend You Can Visit Anytime
A Gardening We Grow
a gum bush
a HOOK
A mad house
A martini
a nice mess you've gotten me into!
A place in the sun
A planet where apes
a problem
A rolling stone gathers no moss. 
A rose by any other name would smell as sweet
A rose is a rose is a rose
A snail's pace
A stepping stone to
A stick in the mud
a temporary solution
A thing of beauty is a joy forever
A thorn in my side
A tree does not move unless there is wind
a very special
A weed is no more than a flower in disguise
A-Duh
Aah, my beer
Abandon ship
About face
Above board
Ace in the hole
Ace up his sleeve

All bent out of shape
All bets are off
All ears
All for onend one for all 
All hands on deck
All hands to the pump 
All heck breaks loose
All in a day's work
All in due time
All my life I've had one dream
all of life's problems.
All over the map
All paled in comparison
All right let's not panic
All right, brain
All right, Mr. DeMille
All talk and no action
All that jazz 
All that meat
All the bits and pieces
All the flowers of tomorrow are in the seeds of yesterday
All things grow with love
All thumbs
All's fair in love and war
All's well that ends well
Allo, Sigfried allo
Allright S'allright
Alvin
Always remember
Always submit to peer pressure
Am I a CLOWN
Am I my brother's keeper? 
Am I talking to a brick wall
Am I turning you on?
Amen
America's health care system
American as apple pie
An angel belongs in the garden
An apple a day keeps the doctor away
An apple never falls far from the tree
An arm and a leg
An ax to grind

Ariel We ride
Armed to the teeth
Around the horn
As all get out
As always
As clear as mud
As cold as ice
As common as dirt
As delicate as a flower
As dense as a London fog
As far as the eye can see
As fresh as a daisy
As God is my witness
As good as gold
As honest as the day is long
As luck would have it
As much use as a yard of pump water
As poor as dirt
As pure as snow
As sensitive as a flower
As slow as molasses
As solid as the ground we stand on
As tender as a mother's heart
As the crow flies
As uneasy as a cat near water
As useful as a lead balloon
As welcome as a skunk at a lawn party
As white as snow
As ye sow, so shall ye reap
Ashes to ashes dust to dust
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Asleep at the wheel
Ass backwards
Ass over tea kettle
At the bottom of the pecking order
At the crack of dawn
At the crack of dawn 
At the drop of a hat
At the eleventh hour
At the end of my rope
At the end of the day
At the last minute
At wits' end

In fine fettle

In harm's way
In hot water

In on the ground floor
In one fell swoop
In season
In the black be

In the clear
In the doghouse
In the garden my soul is sunshine. 
In the hot seat

In the nick of time
In the pink

Isn't that special
It ain't rocket science
It beats picking cotton

it hurts and stuff
It is balloon
It is good to be king
it looks like a miracle
It puts the lotion
It stinks 
It takes two to tango
It was Beauty killed the Beast.
it went farther in my brain
it went in my brain
It will do
It won't fly
It works for me
It's

It's a bird
It's a dog eat dog world
It's a game of inches
It's a lemon
It's a mad house
it's a plane
It's a wash
It's alive
It's alive!  It's alive!
It's all over but the crying
It's alright mum
It's autumn in her mouth and all her tongue can do is rustle! 
It's better to bend than to break
It's business
It's chicken feed
it's Chinatown.
It's crime fighting time
It's fun
It's going to be a bumpy night
It's hot
It's in the bag
It's in the cards
It's in the hole! 
It's my way
It's never too late to learn
It's not nice
It's not over till it's over
It's not the heat, it's the humidity
It's now or never
It's show time energy
It's the pictures that got small
It's time to duel
Its a small world
its Saturday Night live
it’s been painful and disturbing
Jam on it!

Ugly as a mud fence
Ugly as sin
