he breasted his cards
he got plastered
he has a few loose screws
he has a way with words
he has egg on his face
he learned his lesson
he left no stone unturned
he let the cat out of the bag
he lost his shirt
he made a mad dash for it
he put one over on me
he spilled the beans
he thinks he knows everything
he was the life of the party
he went the whole 9 yards.
he who hesitates is lost
he won, hands down
he's a bald faced liar
he's a bubble shy of plumb
he's a corn-fed hick
he's a dark horse
he's a fall guy
he's a natural
he's a smooth operator
he's all flibberty jibbets
he's an easy study
he's changing his tune
he's chomping at the bit
he's dressed to the nines
he's feeling his oats
he's fishing for compliments
he's gone to ground
he's hen pecked
he's milktoast
he's over the hill
he's pulling your leg
he's pushing up daisies
he's really on the ball
he's scared of his own shadow
he's so matter-of-fact

it is my secret
it is so cold
it is so windy
it just goes to show...
it stands to reason
it took my breath away
it was a piece of cake
it was a white-knuckle ride
it was an ill-fated idea
it will be a cold day in hell
it's a catch 22
it's a dog-eat-dog world
it's a fix
it's a freckle past a hair
it's a long shot
it's a one-horse town
it's all in your head
it's cutting edge
it's neck and neck
it's never too late to learn
it's not over till it's over
it's not written in stone
it's nothing earth-shattering
it's on the tip on my tongue
it's only a matter of time

you can't take it with you
you could put your eye out
you drive me crazy
you drive me nuts
you drive me up a wall
you gotta put your foot down
you hit the nail on the head
you lie like a dog
you lie like a rug
you must be out of your mind
you only live once
you win some you lose some
you're all wet
you're dead meat
you're driving me insane
you're having a laugh
