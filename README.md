Pafwert
=======

Pafwert is a unique tool to help you to select strong passwords that are easy to remember. Pafwert suggests sample passwords that you can use to formulate a strong password that works for you. Using strong entropy, tens of thousands of seed words, more than a hundred patterns with endless variations, and following password best practices, Pafwert can help you to select very strong passwords that are surprisingly easy to memorize. We have all seen random password generators, but Pafwert is surprisingly different.
What makes Pafwert different than every other password generator? It’s simple, most random password generators spit out passwords like these that are impossible to remember:
- KBYd4ie*2
- $4WN2Kxp
- IQh58&Yh
- da1z#VW4

While Pafwert generates passwords like these that are actually much stronger and actually kind of fun to remember:
- bone.horse.berner
- Miss. Undercarriage
- orangeslapperdotgov
- Anaxtogrind v2.0

Now it doesn’t take much to realize that users are much more willing to use strong passwords with just a little help from Pafwert. And don’t knock the simplicity–it’s much smarter than you think.

About
-------
I began development on this tool as a Perl script in 2000. Over the years I have spent way too much time overthinking and overdeveloping something as simple as a password generator, but Pafwert is the result. If you would like to get a taste of how complex Pafwert really is under the surface, I suggest reading the Pattern Guide.

Pafwert is a VB6 application and I have not done any development on it since 2007 but I do have a complete development VM available if someone really is serious about making modifications. What I would like to see is Pafwert simplified and moved to a PHP library that anyone can integrate into their own applications.
